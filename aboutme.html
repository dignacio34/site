		<p class="bio">Hi! I'm Daniella Ignacio, and I am a performer and arts journalist, originally from northern New Jersey. I am currently a sophomore at American University, where I am pursuing a double major in B.A. Musical Theatre and B.A. Journalism. The work that I love as a musical theatre performer ranges from the Golden Age shows that makes my soprano heart sing, to new works that push the boundaries of what's possible in musical theatre. I'm particularly inspired by works like <I>Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812</I> and <I>Hadestown</I>.</p>
		<p class="bio">My main focus as a journalist is arts and cultural criticism, as well as news and feature writing. My background in research and reporting has also lent itself well to dramaturgical work (and, I hope, to works of documentary theatre in the future), and my multimedia skills can also be used to create content for public relations in theaters. I'm super interested in all the ways that I can combine practices from the two majors I'm studying!</p>
		<p class="bio">At American, I appeared in the Department of Performing Arts' <i>Othello</i> (Ensemble) and <i>Overture 2017</i> (Ensemble), and stage managed <i>The Government Inspector</i>. I've also performed in <i>Ghost Sonata</i> (Dead Person) and was a dramaturg for <i>Hamletmachine</i> with the Rude Mechanicals. I'm the Outreach Director for the Rudes' 2019-20 season, and was the associate artistic director for 2018-19. I'm on the managing editor team for The Eagle, where I am the Copy Editor and oversee a staff of assistant copy editors. I was previously the Music Editor and a staff writer.</p>
		<p class="bio">As a theatre artist and journalist, I strive to tell stories that matter and deeply believe in the power of storytelling as a force for good and change in the world. When I'm not performing or writing, you can often find me learning how to play new string instruments (currently working on ukulele and guitar!), rereading Harry Potter for the 100th time or petting every dog in sight! </p>
